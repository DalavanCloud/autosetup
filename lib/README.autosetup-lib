Files (*.tcl and *.auto) in this directory are optional modules which
can be loaded with the 'use' directive.

Files named *.auto are auto-load modules.

Modules which are publically documented (@MODULE ...), and auto-load modules are installed
stand-alone in order to facilitate understanding by autosetup
end-users.

All other modules are private/internal and are combined with the
main script when installed.
